# Gamer Dating Full-Stack Application


## OVERVIEW

Gaming is more than just a hobby, it's a passion and a community.  Our dating app is designed specifically for gamers, whether you're into console gaming, PC gaming, or both. Our goal is to help you connect with the perfect match on our platform.
